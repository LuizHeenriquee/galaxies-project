<h1>Galaxies Project</h1>

<p>
  As said, this project is part of Rocketseat's Web/Mobile Development course and it was there where I learned how to use the display grid.
</p>
<p>
  However, I decided to recreate it using not only the grid, but also responsiveness (I learned a module before grid) and make the same web page for different devices.
